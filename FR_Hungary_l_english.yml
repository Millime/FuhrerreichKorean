#### EVENTS ####
################

hun.1.t:0 "Hungary, A Nation Destroyed"
hun.1.d:0 "When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1919, Hungary was left in a state of political turmoil and unrest. Several democratic and radical governments attempted to seize power over the next two years until a combined Romanian-Franco-Serbian army marched on Budapest and occupied over two thirds of the nation. After the signing of the Treaty of Trianon, the Entente powers installed a weak democratic regime and left the nation to its own devices. After several hard years of weak and innefective governing, the 1932 general election saw the rise of the hyper-nationalist and militant 'Arrow Cross' party to power in Hungary. \n\nIn 1936, the Hungarian regime is without a professional army, a practically nonexistant economy, and a completely diplomatically isolated position in Europe. The road ahead will be rough, and the Arrow Cross will need to bring the entire nation together in order to save the Hungarian State from complete destruction."
hun.1.a:0 "Onward, to victory!"
###
hun.2.t:0 "Hungary wishes to purchase weapons"
hun.2.d:0 "The Hungarian government has been moving towards a policy of secret rearmament, and they have approached us with a request to purchase weapons from our stockpile in order to arm the military they plan on building. Giving the Hungarians some weapons could turn them into a useful ally in the future, and it may lead to the intertwining of our economies."
hun.2.a:0 "We will send them many guns"
hun.2.b:0 "We will send them some guns"
hun.2.c:0 "We cannot spare and weapons"
###
hun.3.t:0 "Germany sends us weapons!"
hun.3.d:0 "We have received word from the German government, they have agreed to secretly send guns into the nation that will be added to our national stockpile. This is a valuable step in the rearmament of our nation and the rebuilding of our army."
hun.3.a:0 "One step closer to victory."
###
hun.4.t:0 "Germany denies us weapons"
hun.4.d:0 "The German Government has officially denied our request to purchase several thousand weapons from their stockpile for use in our army. We will have to produce our own weapons with our own factories it would seem."
hun.4.a:0 "Such a shame"
###
hun.5.t:0 "Hungary demands the return of Transylvania"
hun.5.d:0 "After months of seemingly unchecked military buildup and expansion, the Hungarian government has decided to send a formal demand of the territories of all land east of the Tisza river and west of the Carpathian mountains. This would mean the surrender of Transylvania, Banat, and over one million ethnic Romanians currently living within our borders. Accepting this demand would be a national tragedy and completely destroy any national prestige we currently hold."
hun.5.a:0 "We are not afraid of the Hungarian menace!"
hun.5.b:0 "We cannot afford a war with the Hungarians."
###
hun.6.t:0 "Romania refuses to return Transylvania"
hun.6.d:0 "The Romanian government has officially declined our demands for Transylvania, and diplomatic ties have very quickly broken down into silence. We have been left with no other options, we must liberate Transylvania by force."
hun.6.a:0 "Then it is war..."
###
hun.7.t:0 "Romania cedes Transylvania"
hun.7.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Romanian government has accepted all of our territorial demands and has begun the complete military evacuation of Transylvania, making way for our soldiers to march in and occupy the cities with no resistance. This is a glorious day in Hungarian history, and will be known for all time as our 'reclaimation day'."
hun.7.a:0 "Hungarians everywhere rejoice in your liberation!"
###
hun.8.t:0 "Hungary demands Alföld"
hun.8.d:0 "The Hungarian government has sent us a small list of demands today, including the return of the territory of Alföld. The lands of Alföld were occupied in 1920 and the Tisza river was set up as the natural border between Hungary and Romania. Soon however, the lands proved to be economically unviable and unrest in the lands was always higher than the rest of Transylvania and Banat. While we would be surrendering a valuable defensive border, perhaps returning the land is the best choice for the continued stability and prosperity of Romania. Perhaps the Hungarians will be satisfied with Alföld, and stop persuing further territorial demands."
hun.8.a:0 "Not an inch of ground will be ceded!"
hun.8.b:0 "Give Alföld back to Hungary."
###
hun.9.t:0 "Romania refuses to cede Alföld"
hun.9.d:0 "Sadly, the Romanian government has refused our offer to take control over Alföld, and we have been left with only one option; to take it back with force."
hun.9.a:0 "We will be in Budapest by the end of the month"
###
hun.10.t:0 "Romania transfers Alföld"
hun.10.d:0 "The Romanian government has responded to our offer, and they have agreed to transfer the land of Alföld back to Hungary. The Romanian soliders are evacuating the region and our militia are walking into the cities with no resistance, and we are in fact being welcomed with joy from the local residents."
hun.10.a:0 "First Alföld, next Transylvania."
###
hun.11.t:0 "Transylvanian Volunteers arive in Hungary!"
hun.11.d:0 "It would seem that our jingoistic spirit towards the reclaimation of Alföld and Transylvania has sparked some nationalism across the region, flocks of volunteer soldiers using stolen Romanian equipment are arriving across the Tizsa river and have sworn allegiance to our regime. They will surely come in handy in the reclaimation of Alföld and Transylvania, and we can expect more volunteers to arrive the longer we wait."
hun.11.a:0 "Rise, Magyars everywhere!"
###
hun.12.t:0 "Hungarian volunteers rise up in Transylvania!"
hun.12.d:0 "Following our invasion of Romania, several groups of Hungarians living in Transylvania have taken up arms and pledged their alliegance to the Hungarian state."
hun.12.a:0 "Wonderful."
###
hun.13.t:0 "Liberation Day"
hun.13.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]"July 7 1932, a date which all Hungarians should remember, for it is the day that our liberation officially begun. We have worked tirelessly and endlessly to restore the Hungarian state to the glory it once held, before the Western Imperialists sought to impose their will upon us, and skewer us upon a pike outside the palace at Versallies. The liberation of all Hungarians around the world is at hand, and we are reaching ever closer to our goal of ethnic hegemony by the day. But we must not diminish our resolve, we must remain steadfast and hardy, and prepare for the wars and battles that are to come. Only when all our foes lie dead before us can we say the day is done, only when all Magyars live under one state can we say that our destiny has been acomplished.""
hun.13.a:0 "Arise, Magyars everywhere!"
###
hun.15.t:0 "Democratic rallies in Pécs"
hun.15.d:0 "Following the election of the Arrow Cross party in Hungary, several democratic groups formed a coalition party under the banner of the F48P in opposition and protest. This party remains the only large political group that could pose any sort of threat towards us and our grip on the nation. While it is extremely unlikely that this party will stand any chance of actually toppling our regime, it would still be in our best interests to curtail their influence and power. We could put a large effort into diminishing the power of the F48P, but it may not be wise to cause mass agitation before we have secured our powerbase."
hun.15.a:0 "Take extensive measures to curtail their power"
hun.15.b:0 "Take reasonable measures to curtail their power"
hun.15.c:0 "They are not a threat to us."
###
hun.16.t:0 "Gaszton Gaál assassinated!"
hun.16.d:0 "The FKgP party was founded recently in Hungarian history, in the year 1930. The party rose to prominance in response to the collapsing Hungarian economy and its effect on the agrarian population in the country. While never winning or contesting any elections, the party managed to pressure the government into implimenting slight reforms that made life a little easier on the farmers. Still, this was not enough, and food production in Hungary has always teetered on the brink of inadequacy. Gaszton Gaál was perhaps the most vocal member of the party, and ran in local elections under the FKgP's banner. While the majority of the party broke off to form a coalition under the F48P, a very small fringe group of hardline members stuck around to keep the spirit of the party alive. While not the official leader of the party, Gaszton was reportedly in the city of Dunaújváros attempting to gather support for his party when a shot rung out from somewhere in the crowd, and Gaszton fell to the ground. This event has shook what remaining members the party had to their core, and support for the FKgP is dwindling to the point where popular support for the party is practically nonexistant. While the gunman's identity remains unknown, he is believed to be a member of the Arrow Cross, seemingly looking to protect our interests by resorting to such barbaric acts as political assassination!"
hun.16.a:0 "Interesting"
###
hun.17.t:0 "Factory bombing in Budapest!"
hun.17.d:0 "Explosions could be heard coming from the industrial district near the nations capital yesterday, as several explosive devices were set off inside a factory. The attack occured around 10am today, as the factory workers were just beginning their shifts. Several men were killed and dozens more injured as a large portion of the factory collapsed due to a loss of structural integrety. An investigation is currently ongoing to find the motive behind this attack, but it is clear that dark forces are at work trying to undermine our power."
hun.17.a:0 "How unfortunate."
###
hun.18.t:0 "Socialists caused the bombing!"
hun.18.d:0 "The investigation into the factory bombing that took place 6 days ago has finally concluded, with the detectives finally determining that it was a radicalized member of the Balközép party by the name of Biró Ferenc who planted the bombs before slipping away into the countryside. The detectives found a copy of the Communist Manifesto adressed to him by someone named Mátyás Rákosi, and a full investigation has begun into the lives of these two men. Security around the city of Budapest has been increased, and anyone accused to being a socialist is shunned from their family and public life. This "red scare" is vastly diminishing the influence that the reds hold in the fringes of our country. It would appear that some good has come of this tragedy after all."
hun.18.a:0 "Damned reds..."
###
hun.19.t:0 "The Hungarian Economy"
hun.19.d:0 "Following Hungary's defeat in the Great War, a series of revolutions and counter-revolutions took place across the nation, until a combined army of French, Serbian, Romanian, and Czechoslovak soldiers entered Budapest and restored order. The democratic government put in place was little more than a puppet to the Serbs and Romanians, and with each coming election the Hungarian election entered a sharper and deeper decline. These events culminated in the September 23rd riots which in 1928 saw thousands of civilians take to the streets in order to physically take money from the banks that were withholding it. These riots destroyed many banks, and faith in the economy was completely shattered when the Hungarian government declared the currency null and void in an attempt to combat the hyperinflation gripping the nation. The Romanians and Serbs that were allegedly "protecting" the Hungarian people were content to sit and watch as the Hungarian nation collapsed in on itself. It was this complete economic ruin, combined with a feeling of utter betrayal by Hungary's neighbors, that led to the rise of the popular Arrow Cross party, and their landslide victory in the 1932 general election."
hun.19.a:0 "Repairing the economy must be our top priority!"
###
hun.20.t:0 "The Legalization of Unions"
hun.20.d:0 "Trade Unions have been illegal in Hungary since the government banned them in 1926 out of a fear of rising socialism in the nation. With the Arrow Cross in firm control of the country, perhaps it is time we re-evaluated the national stance on the legality of Unions."
hun.20.a:0 "Unions will never be legalized!"
hun.20.b:0 "Perhaps some liberalization isn't a bad idea..."
###
hun.21.t:0 "Hungary demands the return of Southern Slovakia!"
hun.21.d:0 "Following the renunciation of the Treaty of Trianon, the Hungarian state has begun to rebuild their military to unprecidented heights. They now seek to challenge our authority over the historically Slovak lands that border their nation and have sent a formal demand for the "return" of those lands to Hungarian rule. accepting this demand will make the government look exceptionally weak, and radical elements within the country may see it as an oppertunity to strike, but can we really afford a war with the Hungarians at this stage?
hun.21.a:0 "We cannot afford a war"
hun.21.b:0 "Not an inch of ground will be given!"
###
hun.22.t:0 "Slovakia concedes to our demands"
hun.22.d:0 ""

hun.29.t:0 "Sándor Márai - A Night in Budapest"
hun.29.d:0 "Famed Hungarian writer and journalist Sándor Márai has announced today that he has finished his lifes work, a novel titled "A Night in Budapest" Sándor has already recieved critic acclaim from across Hungary for his excellent portrayal of Hungarian pride and nationalism in the form of an interesting and layered novel with complex characters and locations. \n\nThe novel begins in 1848, in the midst of the Hungarian Revolution and their attempt at leaving the iron grip of the Austrian Habsburgs. Following a string of military victories in Galicia and Bohemia, along with Prussian intervention on the side of the Hungarians, the Austrians are forced to recognize the independance of the Hungarian state as well as ceding authority over Dalmatia to Hungary. What followed shortly afterwards was a complete collapse of Habsburg authority over the remaining Cisleithanian lands, as regional warlords attempted to carve their own states out of the collapsing empire. \n\nIn 1908, a diplomatic crisis occurs in Bosnia when Hungary sends soldiers into the territory under the pretense of quelling the unrest, but ends up annexing the lands into the Hungarian crown, to the objection of Russia, France, and the weakened Ottoman Empire. The following conflict ended up spanning four continents and six years as Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania tears itself apart under two alliance blocs. The war ends in a Hungarian-Prussian-British victory, but at a very high cost to all nations. The novel ends with the Hungarian and Prussian kingdoms on the brink of revolution, and the British empire struggling to maintain its overextedned empire in an age of guns, germs, and steel. \n\n[HUN.GetLeader] has praised Sándor for his work, and is considering making the novel a national treasure. This novel will not be soon forgotten, and there are even rumors of it being turned into a board game under the Swedish game developers "Contradiction Interactive"."
hun.29.a:0 "What a read!"
###
hun.30.t:0 "The Foundation of the Slovak People's Army?"
hun.30.d:0 "With our conquest of Slovakia now complete, many generals have suggested the formation of a battlegroup made up entirely of Slovak 'volunteers' in order to integrate them with the Hungarian army and beign the process of assimilating the Slovak people into the Hungarian culture once more. \n\nWhile there are obvious benifits to enacting this decision, many who served in the k.u.k. army during the Great War are quick to point out the Czechoslovak betrayal and their feeble attempt at carving a nation-state out of Hungarian lands. These men believe that arming the Slovaks will only incite unrest and lead to an armed revolt led by Slovak patriots. However, we may very well need these men in the war against Romania, and every single gun counts on the field of battle..."
hun.30.a:0 "A phenomenal idea!"
hun.30.b:0 "Arming the Slovaks will only bring us trouble."
###
hun.31.t:0 "Hungarian citizen murdered in Szolnok"
hun.31.d:0 "Several nights ago in the city of Szolnok, a young Hungarian boy by the name of János Téli was found dead and dismembered in the ditch next to the house of one of the butchers living in the city. Many citizens are accusing the butcher of killing the boy, but no solid evidence has come up against him. \n\nSeveral anti-semetic groups in the city are placing the blame on the small Jewish population living within its borders, claiming it was a 'ritual killing' and was planned far in advance. These anti-semetic groups are inciting violence against the Jewish population and there have already been several incidents of targeted attacks against shops and homes owned and inhabited by Jews. The mayor claims the violence will subside and the local police can deal with the situation, but we should keep a close eye on the city in case it escalates."
hun.31.a:0 "How Tragic!"
###
hun.32.t:0 "Anti-semetic violence spreads"
hun.32.d:0 "Despite what the mayor said, the violence directed against the Jewish population of Eastern Hungary has spread throughout the city and the local synagogue has been attacked numerous times by angry mobs hoping to tear it down. Several Jewish butchers are suspected of partaking in the murder, including Jordánia Kovács, the main suspect in the investigation. The city is requesting that a small regiment be sent in to take control of the city and restore order."
###
hun.40.t:0 "Hungary requests German investment"
hun.40.d:0 "The Hungarian government has been working tirelessly over the past years in an attempt to bring the Hungarian economy back from the brink of total and utter collapse, and it would seem that their latest gambit is to seek investment from German industry. The Hungarians wish to have German factories built within their territory with the dual goal of increasing production effeciancy as well as learning our industrial methods."
